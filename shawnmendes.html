          <p> Ok, this is about my obsession with shawn mendes, otherwise known as shawn peter raul mendes, shawnie, benito, 
          muffinboy, or my little benito muffinboy. Well, here's my story in a very short version, because I really don't feel
          like writing a lot.
          So, it all started on January 14 2018, when I was just very bored after I showered, and I was listening to 99.9 Virgin
          Radio. They were playing a shawnie song, Treat You Better, which is an incredible song, just like any other shawn 
          song, so I decided to look him upon the internet. And, ohhh I immediately fell in love, and found who the true love
          of my life was. Shawnie Benito Muffin Peter Raul What The Hell Is Yeast Mendes. He is only 19, and has accomplished so
          much, like ohhh I feel so proud of him💗
